   Visual comparison of convolution, cross-correlation and autocorrelation (from wiki).

   For the operations involving function :math:`f` , and assuming the height of :math:`f` is 1.0, the value of the result at 5 different points is indicated by the shaded area below each point. Also, the vertical symmetry of :math:`f` is the reason :math:`f*g` , :math:`f*g` are identical in this example.
